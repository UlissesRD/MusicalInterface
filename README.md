The program is a musical interface that has some buttons, and each one of them plays a different song that is written on it.

## Prerequisites 🔧

The project was built using version 19.0.2 of the Java SE Development Kit from Oracle.

It's worth noting that this project was developed and tested on the Windows operating system.

If you don't have Java installed, please visit the Oracle website for installation:
https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk19-archive-downloads.html

If you don't have an IDE, you can choose one according to your preference, but I recommend one of these two:
- IntelliJ: https://www.jetbrains.com/pt-br/idea/download/?section=windows
- VSCode: https://code.visualstudio.com/download

### Operation⚙️

When you run the application, it will open a web page.

That web page has 9 buttons, each with a different song. You can play a song by clicking the button with your mouse or by using the TAB key to select the button you want and pressing SPACE or ENTER to play it.

It is a simple application, but very useful for learning a bit more about JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
